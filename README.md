🚀 Deep Learning | Medical Image Analysis | Segmentation

Welcome to my Computer Vision portfolio! I specialize in deep learning for medical imaging, particularly segmentation aand classification tasks. My projects focus on automating medical diagnostics using state-of-the-art deep learning models.

📌 Projects

🏥 1. Whole Prostate Segmentation using nnU-Net

🔹 Description:

Developed a deep learning pipeline using nnU-Net for automatic prostate segmentation from MRI scans, aiding in cancer detection and treatment planning.

🔹 Key Features:

✅ Preprocessed and normalized MRI scans

✅ Handled class imbalance with augmentation strategies

✅ Trained nnU-Net with optimized hyperparameters

✅ Evaluated results using Dice coefficient, IoU, Hausdorff distance

🔹 Dataset: ProstateX dataset

🔹 Tools & Libraries: Python, PyTorch, nnU-Net, ITK-SNAP, matplotlib
